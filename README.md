The above is the game start screen, with several options of gameplay to choose from.

Selecting 'Level Mode' brings up a GUI with a level selector, and infinite enemies mode has no end (until you die).

The level you choose, in 'Level Mode' determines the number of enemies you spawn and their difficulty.

If you can get 100 points, you beat the level!

The default level is 20 for the infinite enemies gamemode.

The longer you play the infinite enemies mode, the harder it gets and the faster the enemies are spawned!

The red enemies have more lives and will take out your base as soon as they hit, if you let them!

Enemies are not revealed until the sweeper arm of the radar passes over them.

Have fun, thanks for playing!
